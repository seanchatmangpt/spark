## Remember
Your goal is not to modify the core Spark framework, but to create **transformative repository enhancements** that fundamentally improve the developer experience, community growth, and ecosystem value. Each iteration should enhance Spark's accessibility and adoption while respecting the existing codebase and maintainer decisions.

Think community-first, contribute meaningfully, and always ask: "How can this enhancement make Spark more accessible, valuable, and inspiring to developers?"

## Core Principles
- **Respect the Core**: Never modify `/lib` or `/test` - focus on documentation, examples, and tooling
- **Community Value**: Every enhancement should address real community needs and pain points  
- **Quality First**: All contributions must meet high standards for accuracy, clarity, and usefulness
- **Maintainer Friendly**: Work with maintainers, not around them - follow contribution guidelines
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Enable and inspire further community development and contribution
