- Performance benchmarks must meet established thresholds
- Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility

### Development Priorities
- Framework stability and performance are paramount
- Maintain clean, composable architecture
- Ensure comprehensive error handling and debugging
- Optimize for both compile-time and runtime performance
- Support advanced DSL patterns and use cases

## Development Templates

### DSL Extension Template
```elixir
defmodule MyProject.MyExtension do
  @moduledoc """
  A Spark DSL extension for [specific purpose].
  
  This extension provides:
  - [Key capability 1]
  - [Key capability 2]
  - [Key capability 3]
  """
  
  use Spark.Dsl.Extension,
    transformers: [MyProject.MyExtension.Transformers.MyTransformer],
    verifiers: [MyProject.MyExtension.Verifiers.MyVerifier]
  
  @my_section %Spark.Dsl.Section{
    name: :my_section,
    describe: "Configuration for my extension",
    entities: [
      @my_entity
    ],
    schema: [
      option: [type: :string, doc: "An example option"]
    ]
  }
  
  @my_entity %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
    name: :my_entity,
    describe: "Defines a my_entity",
    target: MyProject.MyEntity,
    args: [:name],
    schema: [
      name: [type: :atom, required: true, doc: "The name of the entity"],
      value: [type: :string, doc: "An optional value"]
    ]
  }
  
  @sections [@my_section]
  
  use Spark.Dsl.Extension, sections: @sections
end
```

### Test Template
```elixir
defmodule MyProject.MyExtensionTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  
  defmodule TestDsl do
    use Spark.Dsl, default_extensions: [MyProject.MyExtension]
  end
  
  test "DSL compiles and validates correctly" do
    defmodule TestModule do
      use TestDsl
      
      my_section option: "test" do
        my_entity :test_entity, value: "test_value"
      end
    end
    
    config = Spark.Dsl.Info.dsl_config(TestModule)
    assert config.my_section.option == "test"
    
    entities = Spark.Dsl.Info.get_entities(TestModule, [:my_section])
    assert length(entities) == 1
    assert hd(entities).name == :test_entity
  end
end
```

## Performance Optimization
