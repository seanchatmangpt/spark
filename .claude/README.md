# Spark DSL Framework Development Configuration

> *"The best DSLs feel inevitable—as natural as thinking itself."*

## Overview

This directory contains enhancement configuration and documentation for the **Spark DSL Framework**. These configurations support building valuable resources around the existing framework through documentation, examples, and tooling - without modifying core framework code (`/lib` and `/test`).

## What is Spark DSL?

Spark DSL is a framework that enables developers to create powerful Domain-Specific Languages in Elixir. It provides:

1. **Extension System** - Build reusable DSL components with entities, transformers, and verifiers
2. **Code Generation** - Transform DSL definitions into efficient Elixir code
3. **Validation** - Comprehensive compile-time and runtime validation
4. **Introspection** - Runtime access to DSL configuration and metadata
5. **Documentation** - Auto-generate documentation from DSL definitions

This creates expressive, declarative APIs that feel natural and intuitive.
