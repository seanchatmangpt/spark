# Spark DSL Infinite Agentic Loop System

> *"The best DSLs feel inevitable—as natural as thinking itself."*

## Overview

This directory contains the configuration and state management for an **Infinite Agentic Loop** system specifically designed for Spark DSL development. Unlike traditional development workflows that require human intervention at each step, this system operates autonomously to generate, evaluate, and iterate on Domain-Specific Language solutions.

## What is an Infinite Agentic Loop?

An infinite agentic loop is an AI system that:
1. **Generates** solutions autonomously based on objectives and constraints
2. **Evaluates** those solutions against comprehensive quality criteria  
3. **Iterates** by refining and improving based on evaluation feedback
4. **Learns** from each cycle to improve future generations
5. **Operates continuously** without requiring human intervention for each cycle

This creates a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement and innovation.
