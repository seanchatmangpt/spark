## Analysis Types

### Pattern Analysis
Identifies how DSL features are actually being used:
```elixir
# Example output
%UsagePatterns{
  common_configurations: [
    %Pattern{
      frequency: 89.3,
      pattern: "endpoint with auth and validation",
      code_sample: """
      endpoint "/api/users" do
        auth :required
        validate User.changeset()
      end
      """,
      variations: 47
    }
  ],
  underused_features: [
    %UnderusedFeature{
      feature: :custom_middleware,
      usage_rate: 3.2,
      potential_use_cases: ["rate limiting", "custom auth", "logging"]
    }
  ],
  emerging_patterns: [
    %EmergingPattern{
      pattern: "conditional validation based on auth level",
      frequency_trend: :increasing,
      complexity_score: 7.2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Analysis
Monitors real-world DSL performance characteristics:
```elixir
%PerformanceAnalysis{
  compilation_metrics: %{
    average_compile_time: 234.5, # milliseconds
    compile_time_distribution: %{p50: 180, p90: 450, p99: 890},
    compilation_bottlenecks: ["complex validation transformers", "nested entity resolution"]
  },
  runtime_metrics: %{
    average_runtime_overhead: 12.3, # microseconds
    memory_usage: %{baseline: 45, with_dsl: 52}, # KB
    hotspots: ["validation rule execution", "auth rule processing"]
  },
  scaling_characteristics: %{
    entities_vs_compile_time: :linear,
    rules_vs_runtime: :logarithmic,
    breaking_points: [1000, 5000, 10000] # entity counts
  }
}
```

### Pain Point Analysis
Identifies developer friction and common error patterns:
```elixir
%PainPointAnalysis{
  common_errors: [
    %ErrorPattern{
      error_type: "undefined entity reference",
      frequency: 156,
      typical_cause: "typo in entity name",
      suggested_fix: "add spell checking and suggestions"
    }
  ],
  developer_friction: [
    %FrictionPoint{
      area: "debugging complex transformations",
      difficulty_score: 8.7,
      time_cost: "30-60 minutes average",
      improvement_opportunity: "better debugging tools and introspection"
    }
  ],

    %FeatureRequest{
      request: "conditional entity inclusion",
      frequency: 23,
      complexity: :medium,
      impact: :high
    }
  ]
}
```

### Evolution Analysis
Tracks how DSL usage evolves over time:
```elixir
%EvolutionAnalysis{
  usage_trends: [
    %Trend{
      feature: :auth_integration,
      trend: :increasing,
      growth_rate: 23.4, # % per month
      correlation: "security focus increase"
    }
  ],
  complexity_evolution: %{
    average_entities_per_dsl: [12, 15, 18, 22], # last 4 months
    nesting_depth_trend: :increasing,
    custom_extensions_adoption: :rapid_growth
  },
  migration_patterns: [
    %MigrationPattern{
      from: "manual validation",
      to: "DSL-based validation",
      migration_time: "2-4 weeks typical",

    }
  ]
}
```

    Task.async(fn ->
      collect_from_source(dsl_target, time_window, source)
    end)
  end)
  
  raw_data = Task.await_many(data_collection_tasks, :timer.minutes(5))
  
  # Aggregate and normalize data
  aggregated_data = aggregate_data_sources(raw_data)
  
  # Clean and validate data
  clean_and_validate_data(aggregated_data)
end

defp collect_from_source(dsl_target, time_window, :local) do
  # Analyze local project usage
  local_projects = find_local_projects_using_dsl(dsl_target)

  # Analyze public repositories
  Enum.map(search_results, fn repo ->
    analyze_github_repo_usage(repo, dsl_target)
  end)
end

defp collect_from_source(dsl_target, time_window, :hex) do

  # Extract code patterns using AST analysis
  code_patterns = extract_code_patterns(usage_data)
  
  # Identify frequent patterns
  frequent_patterns = identify_frequent_patterns(code_patterns)
  
  # Analyze pattern complexity and evolution
  pattern_analysis = Enum.map(frequent_patterns, fn pattern ->
    %PatternAnalysis{
      pattern: pattern,
      frequency: calculate_frequency(pattern, usage_data),
      complexity_score: calculate_complexity_score(pattern),

      evolution_trend: analyze_pattern_evolution(pattern, usage_data),
      optimization_opportunities: identify_optimization_opportunities(pattern)
    }
  end)
  
  # Identify anti-patterns and problematic usage
  anti_patterns = identify_anti_patterns(code_patterns)
  
  %UsagePatternAnalysis{
    patterns: pattern_analysis,
    anti_patterns: anti_patterns,
    emerging_patterns: identify_emerging_patterns(code_patterns),
    declining_patterns: identify_declining_patterns(code_patterns),
    recommendations: generate_pattern_recommendations(pattern_analysis)
  }
end

defp extract_code_patterns(usage_data) do
  Enum.flat_map(usage_data, fn usage ->
    # Parse DSL usage into AST
    ast_patterns = parse_dsl_usage_to_ast(usage.code)
    
    # Extract meaningful patterns
    extract_meaningful_patterns(ast_patterns)
  end)
end
```

### Performance Impact Analysis
```elixir
def analyze_performance_impact(usage_data, dsl_target) do
  # Collect performance metrics
  performance_data = collect_performance_metrics(usage_data, dsl_target)
  
  # Analyze compilation performance
  compilation_analysis = analyze_compilation_performance(performance_data)
  
  # Analyze runtime performance
  runtime_analysis = analyze_runtime_performance(performance_data)
  
  # Identify performance bottlenecks
  bottlenecks = identify_performance_bottlenecks(performance_data)
  
  # Generate performance recommendations
  recommendations = generate_performance_recommendations(
    compilation_analysis,
    runtime_analysis,
    bottlenecks
  )
  
  %PerformanceImpactAnalysis{
    compilation: compilation_analysis,
    runtime: runtime_analysis,
    bottlenecks: bottlenecks,
    recommendations: recommendations,
    optimization_opportunities: identify_optimization_opportunities(performance_data)

end
```

### Autonomous Improvement Suggestions
```elixir
def generate_improvement_suggestions(analysis_results) do
  # Combine all analysis types
  combined_insights = combine_analysis_insights(analysis_results)
  
  # Generate targeted improvements
  improvements = [
    suggest_api_improvements(combined_insights.patterns),
    suggest_performance_optimizations(combined_insights.performance),
    suggest_usability_enhancements(combined_insights.pain_points),
    suggest_new_features(combined_insights.evolution),
    suggest_deprecations(combined_insights.declining_patterns)

  # Prioritize improvements by impact and effort
  prioritized_improvements = prioritize_improvements(improvements)
  
  # Generate implementation strategies
  implementation_strategies = generate_implementation_strategies(prioritized_improvements)
  
  %ImprovementSuggestions{

## Continuous Monitoring

### Real-Time Analytics
- Monitors DSL usage patterns as they happen
- Detects anomalies and performance regressions
- Alerts on emerging pain points or error patterns

### Trend Detection
- Identifies trending usage patterns
- Predicts future needs based on usage evolution
- Recommends proactive improvements

### Ecosystem Impact Analysis
- Analyzes how DSL changes affect the broader ecosystem
- Predicts migration costs and compatibility issues
- Suggests rollout strategies for improvements

This command enables the SparkDslEcosystem AGI factory to continuously learn from real-world DSL usage and autonomously improve DSL implementations based on actual developer needs and pain points.
