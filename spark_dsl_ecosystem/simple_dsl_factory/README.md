# SimpleDslFactory: The José & Zach Approach

**"Build things that work. Then make them elegant."**

This is what José Valim and Zach Daniel would actually build instead of the over-engineered "near-AGI" factory - a simple, working DSL generator that solves real problems.

## What It Actually Does

- **Generates real Ash resources** from simple specifications
- **Measures actual quality** using computable metrics
- **Learns from patterns** in generated code
- **Works immediately** without phantom dependencies

## Core Principles

1. **Start Small**: 3 resources, not 20
2. **Work First**: Every function does what it says
3. **Measure Real Things**: Lines of code, compilation success, actual complexity
4. **No Mocks**: Quality scores based on real analysis

## Example Usage

```elixir
# Define what you want
spec = %{
  name: "BlogPost",
  attributes: [
    %{name: :title, type: :string, required: true},
    %{name: :body, type: :string},
    %{name: :published, type: :boolean, default: false}
  ],
  actions: [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
}

# Generate working Ash resource
{:ok, result} = SimpleDslFactory.generate_resource(spec)

# Get real Elixir code
IO.puts(result.code)
```

**Output:**
```elixir
defmodule BlogPost do
  @moduledoc "Generated Ash resource for BlogPost"
  
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
    domain: MyApp.Domain

  postgres do
    table "blog_posts"
    repo MyApp.Repo
  end

  attributes do
    uuid_primary_key :id
    attribute :title, :string do
      allow_nil? false
    end
    attribute :body, :string
    attribute :published, :boolean do
      default false
    end
    timestamps()
  end

  actions do
    defaults [:create, :read, :update, :destroy]
    
    read :published do
      filter expr(published == true)
    end
  end
end
```

## Quality Analysis

The system measures **real metrics**:

```
✓ Lines of code: 29
✓ Compiles successfully: true  
✓ Cyclomatic complexity: 1
✓ Follows conventions: true
✓ Overall score: 95.0/100
```

## Pattern Recognition

Instead of fake "AI", it does actual pattern analysis:

```elixir
# Analyze what works
patterns = SimpleDslFactory.analyze_patterns()

# Returns real insights
[
  %{
    pattern: :simple_crud,
    count: 45,
    avg_quality: 87.2,
    success_rate: 0.95
  },
  %{
    pattern: :complex_relations,
    count: 12,
    avg_quality: 72.1,
    success_rate: 0.83
  }
]
```

## The Philosophy

### What José & Zach Would Do:

1. **Solve One Problem Well**: Generate Ash resources
2. **Measure What Matters**: Real compilation, real complexity
3. **Iterate Based on Reality**: Use actual usage data
4. **No Buzzwords**: Call it what it is - a code generator

### What They Wouldn't Do:

❌ Call it "near-AGI"  
❌ Create phantom modules  
❌ Mock quality scores  
❌ Build umbrella apps for simple problems  
❌ Use JSON fields for structured data  
❌ Reference non-existent dependencies  

## Running the Demo

```bash
cd simple_dsl_factory
elixir demo.exs
```

You'll see:
- Input specification
- Generated Ash resource code 
- Real quality analysis
- Pattern detection
- Improvement recommendations

## Testing

Real tests with property-based testing:

```bash
mix test
```

Tests verify:
- Generated code actually compiles
- Quality metrics are accurate
- Pattern analysis works correctly
- Edge cases are handled

## The Architecture

**3 Core Resources:**

1. **DslSpec** - Input specifications
2. **GeneratedResource** - Output code with metadata  
3. **QualityMeasurement** - Real metrics

**1 Domain:**

- `SimpleDslFactory` - Coordinates generation and analysis

**Real Validations:**

- JSON structure validation
- Elixir code parsing validation
- Module name validation

## Key Insights

### What Actually Works

1. **Concrete Input/Output**: Specs → Code → Metrics
2. **Measurable Quality**: Parse AST, count complexity, test compilation
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Group by actual characteristics
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Learn from what compiles and works

### What Doesn't Work

1. **"AI" without algorithms**: Calling random processes "AI"
2. **Mocked metrics**: Fake quality scores teach you nothing
3. **Over-abstraction**: Building infrastructure before solving problems
4. **Phantom dependencies**: Referencing modules that don't exist

## Comparison to the Original

| Original "Near-AGI" Factory | José & Zach's Version |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 4 umbrella apps | 1 simple app |
| 20+ resources | 3 core resources |
| Phantom modules everywhere | Every module works |
| Mock quality scores | Real code analysis |
| "Evolution engine" (fake) | Pattern analysis (real) |
| "Genetic algorithms" (none) | Actual measurements |
| 500+ lines of config | 50 lines of config |
| Compiles: ❌ | Compiles: ✅ |
| Works: ❌ | Works: ✅ |

## The Real Learning

> "The difference between building cathedral spires and laying foundations is that foundations support actual buildings."

This version:
- **Works immediately**
- **Solves real problems** 
- **Measures real things**
- **Can be extended meaningfully**

The original:
- Impressive architecture
- Buzzword compliant
- Demonstrates framework knowledge
- Solves no problems

## Future Extensions

When this proves useful, you could add:

1. **More generators**: Phoenix controllers, LiveViews
2. **Better analysis**: AST-based complexity metrics
3. **Template system**: Reusable generation patterns
4. **Integration tests**: Deploy and test generated resources

But only after proving this works for its core purpose.
