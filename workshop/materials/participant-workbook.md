## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Development Environment Checklist

Complete this checklist before Day 1:

**Elixir Installation:**
- [ ] Elixir 1.15+ installed (`elixir --version`)
- [ ] Erlang/OTP 26+ installed
- [ ] Mix build tool working (`mix --version`)
- [ ] Hex package manager updated (`mix local.hex`)

**Development Tools:**
- [ ] Preferred editor/IDE with Elixir support
- [ ] Git configured with your credentials
- [ ] Terminal/command line comfortable
- [ ] Internet connection tested and stable

**Workshop Dependencies:**
```elixir
# Test by creating a new project and adding these
mix new workshop_test
cd workshop_test

# Add to mix.exs:
{:spark, "~> 2.2.65"},
{:igniter, "~> 0.6.6", only: [:dev]},
{:jason, "~> 1.4"}

# Then run:
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

**Verification Test:**
```elixir
# Create test/workshop_setup_test.exs
defmodule WorkshopSetupTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  
  test "spark dependency works" do
    assert Code.ensure_loaded?(Spark.Dsl)
  end
  
  test "igniter dependency works" do
    assert Code.ensure_loaded?(Igniter)
  end
end
```

Run `mix test` - all tests should pass.

### Required Reading

**Before Day 1:**
- Read "The Philosophy of DSLs" chapter from *The Tao of Spark*
- Review "Core Principles" chapter
- Skim "Your First DSL" chapter (we'll build this together)

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What DSLs do you currently use in your work?

## Daily Learning Guides

## Day 1: Foundations and First Steps

### Daily Objectives
By end of day, you will:
- [ ] Understand the fundamental shift from programming to language design
- [ ] Build a complete personal configuration DSL
- [ ] Add validation and introspection capabilities
- [ ] Experience the joy of creating natural-feeling syntax

### Key Concepts
- **DSL Mindset**: Thinking in domain vocabulary, not implementation details
- **Data-Driven Architecture**: DSL structure as queryable data, not hidden in macros
- **Declarative Expression**: Describing what you want, not how to achieve it
- **Domain Modeling**: Capturing expert knowledge in computational form

### Morning Session Notes

**The Mindset Shift:**
```
Traditional Programming: Problem → Algorithm → Code → Solution
DSL Design: Domain → Language → Usage → Implementation
```

**Key Insight:** Start with how you want the DSL to be used, not how to implement it.

**Live Coding Session - Task Management DSL:**

*Domain Analysis:*
- Tasks: name, priority, due date, assignee, status
- Projects: collection of related tasks
- Workflow: todo → in_progress → done

*Entity Structures:*
```elixir
defmodule TaskDsl.Entities do
  defmodule Task do
    defstruct [:name, :priority, :due_date, :assignee, :status, :description]
  end
  
  defmodule Project do
    defstruct [:name, :description, tasks: []]
  end
end
```

*DSL Definition:*
```elixir
@task %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
  name: :task,
  target: Entities.Task,
  args: [:name],
  schema: [
    name: [type: :string, required: true],
    priority: [type: {:one_of, [:low, :medium, :high]}, default: :medium],
    # ... more fields
  ]
}
```

**Mental Model Check:**
- Does this syntax feel natural for task management?
- What validation would be helpful?
- How might this evolve over time?

### Lab 1.1: Personal Configuration DSL

**Your Challenge:** Build a DSL that captures your personal development environment preferences.

**Design Process:**
1. **Domain Analysis** (15 min)
   - List tools you configure: editor, terminal, projects, git
   - Identify settings you change frequently
   - Note relationships between configurations

2. **Entity Design** (30 min)
   - Create structs for major concepts
   - Define data each entity needs
   - Consider nested relationships

3. **DSL Extension** (45 min)
   - Define entities with schemas
   - Add validation for your specific needs
   - Organize into logical sections

4. **Usage and Testing** (30 min)
   - Create your actual configuration
   - Test edge cases and validation
   - Verify natural feeling

5. **Info Module** (20 min)
   - Add runtime introspection
   - Create helper functions
   - Test configuration access

**Example Structure:**
```elixir
defmodule MyDev.Config do
  use PersonalDsl
  
  editor :vscode do
    theme "Dracula"
    font_size 14
    extensions [:elixir_ls, :vim, :git_lens]
  end
  
  terminal :iterm2 do
    shell :zsh
    theme "Dracula"
    opacity 0.95
  end
  
  workspace do
    base_path "~/code"
    categories do
      category :work, path: "work"
      category :personal, path: "personal"
    end
  end
end
```

**Validation Ideas:**
- Font sizes: 8-72 range
- Paths: should exist or be creatable
- Colors: valid hex codes or named colors
- Extensions: follow marketplace naming

**Reflection Questions:**
- What parts feel most natural to write?
- Where did you struggle with the vocabulary?
- How is this different from config files?

### Lab 1.2: DSL Enhancement

**Advanced Validation:**
```elixir
def validate_color(color) when is_binary(color) do
  cond do
    String.match?(color, ~r/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$/) -> {:ok, color}
    color in ~w[red green blue black white] -> {:ok, color}
    true -> {:error, "Invalid color format"}
  end
end
```

**Enhanced Info Module:**
```elixir
defmodule PersonalDsl.Info do
  use Spark.InfoGenerator, extension: PersonalDsl.Extension
  
  def editor_config(module) do
    case editor(module) do
      {:ok, config} -> config
      :error -> default_editor_config()
    end
  end
  
  def generate_vscode_settings(module) do
    config = editor_config(module)
    %{
      "workbench.colorTheme" => config.theme,
      "editor.fontSize" => config.font_size
    }
    |> Jason.encode!(pretty: true)
  end
end
```

### Day 1 Reflection

**Evening Journaling (10 minutes):**
1. What was the biggest mental shift from code to language thinking?
2. When did your DSL start feeling "right"?
3. What surprised you about domain modeling?
4. How is DSL design different from what you expected?

**Key Insights to Remember:**
- DSLs are about human expression, not just computer instruction
- Start with usage, not implementation
- Domain vocabulary matters more than programming convenience
- Validation enables confidence and prevents errors

**Tomorrow's Preview:**
We move from personal tools to business problems, building production-ready DSLs that solve real organizational challenges.

## Day 2: Real-World Application

### Daily Objectives
- [ ] Design DSLs for actual business problems
- [ ] Master advanced entity and transformer patterns
- [ ] Build production-level API gateway DSL
- [ ] Understand business value and ROI of DSL approach

### Key Concepts
- **Business DSL Design**: Translating requirements into domain languages
- **Advanced Entity Patterns**: Nested structures and composition
- **Transformers**: Compile-time intelligence and code generation
- **Production Considerations**: Performance, scalability, maintainability

### Morning Session Notes

**Business DSL Design Process:**
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Who uses this? What's their mental model?
2. **Vocabulary Mining**: What terms do experts use naturally?
3. **Workflow Mapping**: What processes do people follow?
4. **Pain Point Analysis**: Where do current tools cause friction?
5. **Domain Boundaries**: What's in scope vs. out of scope?

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Over-engineering**: Adding complexity that users don't need
- **Under-constraining**: Not enough validation to prevent errors
- **Mixed concerns**: Putting unrelated concepts in same DSL
- **Implementation leakage**: Exposing technical details in domain interface

### Lab 2.1: API Gateway DSL

**Business Context:** Your organization needs to configure an API gateway that manages multiple backend services with different authentication, rate limiting, and routing requirements.

**Requirements Analysis:**
- **Upstream Services**: Health checks, timeouts, circuit breakers
- **Routing Rules**: Path-based routing with middleware
- **Authentication**: Multiple strategies (JWT, API keys, OAuth)
- **Rate Limiting**: Service-specific and global limits
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection and alerting

**Design Challenge:**
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Gateway do
  use ApiGatewayDsl
  
  upstream :user_service do
    base_url "http://user-service:8080"
    health_check "/health"
    timeout 30_000
    retries 3
    circuit_breaker threshold: 5, timeout: 60_000
  end
  
  routes do
    route "/api/users/*", upstream: :user_service do
      auth :required
      rate_limit 1000
      cache ttl: 300
    end
    
    route "/api/public/*", upstream: :user_service do
      auth :optional
      rate_limit 10000
    end
  end
  
  middleware do
    use :request_id
    use :logging, level: :info
    use :cors, origins: ["https://myapp.com"]
  end
end
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Entity Design** (45 min)
   ```elixir
   defmodule ApiGatewayDsl.Entities do
     defmodule Upstream do
       defstruct [:name, :base_url, :health_check, :timeout, :retries, :circuit_breaker]
     end
     
     defmodule Route do
       defstruct [:path, :upstream, :auth, :rate_limit, :cache, :middleware]
     end
     
     defmodule Middleware do
       defstruct [:name, :config, :order]
     end
   end
   ```

2. **DSL Extension** (60 min)
   ```elixir
   @upstream %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
     name: :upstream,
     target: Entities.Upstream,
     args: [:name],
     schema: [
       name: [type: :atom, required: true],
       base_url: [type: :string, required: true],
       health_check: [type: :string, default: "/health"],
       timeout: [type: :pos_integer, default: 30_000],
       retries: [type: :non_neg_integer, default: 3],
       circuit_breaker: [type: :keyword_list]
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Advanced Features** (45 min)
   - Transformers: Generate route handlers, validate upstream connections
   - Verifiers: Check conflicting routes, validate middleware order
   - Monitoring: Generate Prometheus metrics configuration

**Business Value Discussion:**
- How does this DSL reduce configuration errors?
- What's the time savings vs. manual configuration?
- How does this enable better collaboration between teams?
- What's the maintenance advantage over scattered config files?

### Day 2 Reflection

**Team Presentations (5 min each):**
- Demo your gateway DSL
- Explain one design decision you're proud of
- Share one challenge you overcame

**Key Insights:**
- Business DSLs require deep domain understanding
- Transformers enable powerful compile-time intelligence

      state :pending do
        timeout :timer.minutes(30)
        on_timeout :escalate
        transitions [:processing, :cancelled]
      end
      
      state :processing do
        on_enter &charge_payment/1
        transitions [:shipped, :failed, :refunded]
      end
      
      state :shipped do
        final true
        on_enter &send_tracking/1
      end
    end
    
    transitions do
      transition :process, from: :pending, to: :processing do
        condition &valid_payment?/1
        notify [:customer, :fulfillment]
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Lab 3.2: Extension Development

## Resources and References

### Quick Reference Guides

**Entity Schema Types:**
```elixir
# Basic types
type: :string
type: :integer
type: :boolean
type: :atom

# Constrained types
type: {:one_of, [:option1, :option2]}
type: :pos_integer
type: :non_neg_integer

# Complex types
type: {:list, :string}
type: {:keyword_list, :string}
type: {:map, :string}

# Custom validation
type: {:custom, MyModule, :validate_function, []}
```

**Common Schema Options:**
```elixir
required: true                    # Must be provided
default: "default_value"          # Used if not provided
doc: "Description for docs"       # Documentation string
```

**Info Module Functions:**
```elixir
# Generated automatically:
entities(module)           # Get all entities of this type
entity(module, name)       # Get specific entity (returns {:ok, entity} | :error)
entity!(module, name)      # Get specific entity (returns entity | raises)
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Compilation Errors:**

*"undefined function entity_name"*
- Run `mix spark.formatter` to update `locals_without_parens`
- Restart your editor/language server

*"invalid value for option :type"*
- Check schema type definitions
- Ensure custom validators are properly defined
- Verify required vs. optional field configuration

*"entity not found"*
- Check entity identifier configuration
- Verify entity is properly added to section
- Ensure correct module compilation order

**Development Workflow Issues:**

*Slow compilation*
- Profile with `mix compile --profile`
- Check for circular dependencies in transformers
- Consider splitting large DSL definitions

*IDE not showing autocomplete*
- Ensure ElixirLS is running
- Run `mix spark.formatter`
- Check file associations in editor
