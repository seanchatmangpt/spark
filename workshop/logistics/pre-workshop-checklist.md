## 📋 Complete Checklist

### Technical Setup (Required) ✅

**Workshop Dependencies Verification**
```bash
# Run this test to verify your setup
mix new workshop_verification
cd workshop_verification

# Add these dependencies to mix.exs:
```

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:spark, "~> 2.2.65"},
    {:igniter, "~> 0.6.6", only: [:dev]},
    {:jason, "~> 1.4"},
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.31", only: :dev, runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

```bash
# Then run:
mix deps.get
mix compile
mix test

# All should succeed without errors
```

**Clean Up Test Project**
```bash
cd ..
rm -rf workshop_verification
```

- [ ] ✅ All dependency tests passed successfully

### Reading Preparation (Required) 📚

**Required Reading**
- [ ] Read "The Philosophy of DSLs" chapter from *The Tao of Spark*
- [ ] Read "Core Principles" chapter
- [ ] Skim "Your First DSL" chapter (we'll build this together)

**Optional but Recommended**
- [ ] Read "Why Spark Exists" chapter for deeper context
- [ ] Browse through one real-world example chapter
- [ ] Review Spark documentation basics

### Domain Research (Required) 🔍

**Personal Domain**
- [ ] Identified tools you configure regularly (editor, terminal, git, etc.)
- [ ] Listed settings you change most frequently
- [ ] Noted pain points in current configuration approaches

**Business Domain**
- [ ] Chosen one work domain that could benefit from a DSL
- [ ] Identified key stakeholders who would use such a DSL
- [ ] Listed current tools and their limitations
- [ ] Noted vocabulary that domain experts use naturally

### Reflection Questions (Required) 🤔

Write brief answers to these questions:

**Current DSL Experience**
1. What DSLs do you currently use in your work? (Ecto, Phoenix, config files, etc.)
2. What aspects of those DSLs feel natural vs. awkward?
3. What configuration tasks do you find most frustrating?

**Learning Goals**
1. What specific DSL do you want to build by the end of the workshop?
2. What business problem would it solve?
3. What would success look like for your team if this DSL existed?

**Technical Comfort Level**
1. How comfortable are you with Elixir metaprogramming? (1-10)
2. Have you built any macros before? If so, what for?
3. What aspects of DSL creation are you most curious about?

### Workshop Materials (Provided) 📦

You'll receive these materials on Day 1:
- [ ] Participant workbook (physical copy)
- [ ] USB drive with complete code repository
- [ ] Workshop Slack/Discord invitation
- [ ] Name tag and workshop materials

### Personal Preparation (Recommended) 🎯

**Physical Preparation**
- [ ] Laptop fully charged with charger packed
- [ ] Backup power bank for long coding sessions
- [ ] Comfortable seating cushion (if workshops are all-day)
- [ ] Notebook and pens for analog note-taking
- [ ] Water bottle and healthy snacks

**Mental Preparation**
- [ ] Blocked calendar for full workshop week
- [ ] Arranged coverage for urgent work matters
- [ ] Set expectations with team about limited availability
- [ ] Prepared list of questions you want answered

**Collaboration Mindset**
- [ ] Ready to share knowledge and learn from others
- [ ] Prepared to work in pairs and small groups
- [ ] Open to feedback on your DSL designs
- [ ] Excited to help others when they get stuck

## 🚀 Verification Tests

### Test 1: Basic Elixir Functionality
```bash
# Create and run a simple test
echo 'IO.puts("Hello, Spark Workshop!")' > test.exs
elixir test.exs
rm test.exs
```
Expected output: `Hello, Spark Workshop!`

### Test 2: Mix Project Creation
```bash
mix new test_project
cd test_project
mix compile
cd ..
rm -rf test_project
```
Should complete without errors.

### Test 3: Spark Integration Test
```elixir
# Create test_spark.exs and run with: elixir test_spark.exs

Mix.install([
  {:spark, "~> 2.2.65"}
])

defmodule TestDsl do
  use Spark.Dsl, default_extensions: []
end

IO.puts("✅ Spark integration successful!")
```

### Test 4: Development Environment
- [ ] Open your editor and create a new Elixir file
- [ ] Verify syntax highlighting works
- [ ] Test autocomplete for Elixir modules (try typing `Enum.` and see suggestions)
- [ ] Confirm you can run code from within your editor

## 📋 Final Checklist

**Day Before Workshop**
- [ ] All technical setup completed and verified
- [ ] Required reading completed
- [ ] Domain research and reflection questions answered
- [ ] Workshop location and timing confirmed
- [ ] Laptop and materials prepared
- [ ] Calendar cleared and team notified

**Workshop Day Morning**
- [ ] Laptop charged and materials packed
- [ ] Arrived early for any setup issues
- [ ] Connected to workshop WiFi

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**Elixir Version Issues**
- If using asdf: `asdf install elixir 1.16.1-otp-26 && asdf global elixir 1.16.1-otp-26`
- If using Homebrew: `brew upgrade elixir`
- If on Windows: Use the official installer from elixir-lang.org

**Mix Dependency Issues**
- Run `mix local.hex --force` to update Hex
- Clear mix cache: `mix deps.clean --all`
- Check internet connection for package downloads

**Editor/IDE Issues**
- VS Code: Restart after installing ElixirLS, check Output panel for errors
- Emacs: Ensure `elixir-mode` and `lsp-mode` are properly installed
- Vim: Check that vim-elixir plugin is in your plugin manager's load path

**Git Configuration Issues**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --list  # Verify settings
```

### Getting Help

**Before Workshop**
