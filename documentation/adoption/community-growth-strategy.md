# Community Growth Strategy for Spark DSL
## Building a Self-Sustaining Ecosystem

> "A significant goal of Igniter is to encourage collaboration among developers and attract more individuals to the Elixir community." - Zach Daniel

## Strategic Vision

Based on Zach Daniel's insights about community building and his work to address "silos in the Elixir community," this strategy focuses on creating accessible, searchable, and welcoming pathways for Spark DSL adoption.
