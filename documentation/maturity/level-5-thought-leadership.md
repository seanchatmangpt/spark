## Tutorial 1: Advanced Framework Architecture Innovation

### Learning Objective
Design and implement paradigm-shifting architectural patterns that influence framework evolution.

### Project: Meta-DSL Framework
Create a framework that generates DSL frameworks, demonstrating recursive metaprogramming and architectural innovation.

#### Phase 1: Conceptual Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Research and Analysis**:
```elixir
# Research existing metaprogramming patterns
defmodule MetaFramework.Research do
  @moduledoc """
  Analysis of current DSL patterns and limitations.
  
  Key findings:
  1. DSL creation requires significant boilerplate
  2. Pattern replication across domains
  3. Limited composability of DSL features
  4. Manual integration of tooling
  """
  
  def analyze_current_patterns do
    patterns = [
      :entity_definition,
      :section_composition,
      :transformer_chaining,
      :verifier_orchestration,
      :info_generation
    ]
    
    Enum.map(patterns, &analyze_pattern/1)
  end
  
  defp analyze_pattern(pattern) do
    %{
      pattern: pattern,
      current_approach: describe_current(pattern),
      limitations: identify_limitations(pattern),
      improvement_opportunities: suggest_improvements(pattern)
    }
  end
end
```

**Innovation Hypothesis**:
```elixir
defmodule MetaFramework.Hypothesis do
  @moduledoc """
  Core hypothesis: DSL creation can be abstracted into
  declarative specifications that generate complete
  frameworks with minimal configuration.
  """
  
  def core_hypothesis do
    """
    If we can describe DSL patterns at a higher abstraction level,
    then we can generate complete DSL frameworks that are:
    
    1. More maintainable than hand-written DSLs
    2. More consistent across different domains
    3. Automatically integrated with tooling
    4. Extensible through plugin systems
    5. Self-documenting and self-testing
    """
  end
  
  def success_criteria do
    [
      framework_generation_time: "< 1 minute",
      pattern_reusability: "> 90%",
      tooling_integration: "automatic",
      learning_curve: "< 30 minutes",
      community_adoption: "> 100 developers"
    ]
  end
end
```

#### Phase 2: Meta-DSL Design (Weeks 3-4)

**Framework Specification Language**:
```elixir
defmodule MetaFramework.Specification do
  @moduledoc """
  A DSL for describing DSL frameworks.
  """
  
  use Spark.Dsl.Extension
  
  # Define meta-entities
  @domain %Spark.Dsl.Entity{

    target: MetaFramework.Domain,
    schema: [
      name: [type: :atom, required: true],
      description: [type: :string],
      primary_concepts: [type: {:list, :atom}],
      relationships: [type: :keyword_list, default: []],
      constraints: [type: :keyword_list, default: []],
      tooling: [type: :keyword_list, default: []]
    ]
  }
  
  @concept %Spark.Dsl.Entity{
    name: :concept,
    args: [:name],
    target: MetaFramework.Concept,
    schema: [

  @concepts %Spark.Dsl.Section{
    name: :concepts, 
    entities: [@concept]
  }
  
  use Spark.Dsl.Extension, sections: [@domains, @concepts]
