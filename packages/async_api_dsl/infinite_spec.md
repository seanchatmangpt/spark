# AsyncAPI DSL Infinite Generation Spec

## Objective
Create infinite variations of AsyncAPI DSL architectures, patterns, and implementations that self-improve and explore different approaches to event-driven API specification.

## Generation Focus
Generate uniquely architected AsyncAPI DSL solutions that combine:
- Different Spark DSL patterns
- Novel validation approaches  
- Creative code generation strategies
- Alternative export formats
- Innovative protocol bindings
- Advanced testing frameworks

## Output Requirements
Each iteration should produce a complete, self-contained AsyncAPI DSL implementation file with:
- Unique architectural approach
- Novel DSL entity structures
- Creative transformer patterns
- Innovative validation strategies
- Advanced code generation capabilities

## Naming Convention
`async_api_v{iteration}__{theme}.ex`

## File Structure Template
```elixir
defmodule AsyncApiV{iteration}{Theme} do
  @moduledoc """
  {Theme} - AsyncAPI DSL Implementation
  
  Novel approach: {unique_architectural_concept}
  Innovation: {key_innovation}
  """
  
  use Spark.Dsl, default_extensions: [extensions: [AsyncApiV{iteration}{Theme}.Dsl]]
  
  # Self-contained implementation with unique patterns
  # {implementation_details}
end
```

## Themes to Explore
- Functional composition patterns
- Actor-based message routing
- Stream processing integration
- Real-time validation pipelines
- AI-powered schema inference
- Quantum communication protocols
- Blockchain event attestation
- Neural network message routing
- Distributed consensus patterns
- Edge computing optimizations

## Self-Improvement Criteria
Each iteration should:
1. Build upon previous patterns
2. Introduce novel architectural concepts
3. Solve unique AsyncAPI challenges
4. Demonstrate measurable improvements
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Success Metrics
- Compilation without errors
- Unique architectural patterns
- Novel problem-solving approaches
- Code elegance and readability
- Performance characteristics
- Innovation factor (1-10 scale)
