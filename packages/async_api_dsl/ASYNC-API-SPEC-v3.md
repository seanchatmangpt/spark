Introduction
The AsyncAPI Specification is a project used to describe message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format. Itâ€™s protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over any protocol (e.g., AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, STOMP, HTTP, Mercure, etc).

The AsyncAPI Specification defines a set of fields that can be used in an AsyncAPI document to describe an application's API. The document may reference other files for additional details or shared fields, but it is typically a single, primary document that encapsulates the API description.

The AsyncAPI document SHOULD describe the operations an application performs. For instance, consider the following AsyncAPI definition snippet:


channels:
  userSignedUp:
    # ...(redacted for brevity)
operations:
  onUserSignedUp:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: "#/channels/userSignedUp"
It means that the application will receive messages from the userSignedUp channel.

The AsyncAPI specification does not assume any kind of software topology, architecture or pattern. Therefore, a server MAY be a message broker, a web server or any other kind of computer program capable of sending and/or receiving data. However, AsyncAPI offers a mechanism called "bindings" that aims to help with more specific information about the protocol.

It's NOT RECOMMENDED to derive a receiver AsyncAPI document from a sender one or vice versa. There are no guarantees that the channel used by an application to receive messages will be the same channel where another application is sending them. Also, certain fields in the document like summary, description, and the id of the operation might stop making sense. For instance, given the following receiver snippet:


operations:
  onUserSignedUp:
    summary: On user signed up.
    description: Event received when a user signed up on the product.
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: "#/channels/userSignedUp"
We can't automatically assume that an opposite application exists by simply replacing receive with send:


operations:
  onUserSignedUp: # <-- This doesn't make sense now. Should be something like sendUserSignedUp.
    summary: On user signed up. # <-- This doesn't make sense now. Should say something like "Sends a user signed up event".
    description: Event received when a user signed up on the product. # <-- This doesn't make sense now. Should speak about sending an event, not receiving it.
    action: send
    channel:
      $ref: "#/channels/userSignedUp"
Aside from the issues mentioned above, there may also be infrastructure configuration that is not represented here. For instance, a system may use a read-only channel for receiving messages, a different one for sending them, and an intermediary process that will forward messages from one channel to the other.

Definitions
Server
A server MAY be a message broker that is capable of sending and/or receiving between a sender and receiver. A server MAY be a service with WebSocket API that enables message-driven communication between browser-to-server or server-to-server.

Application
An application is any kind of computer program or a group of them. It MUST be a sender, a receiver, or both. An application MAY be a microservice, IoT device (sensor), mainframe process, message broker, etc. An application MAY be written in any number of different programming languages as long as they support the selected protocol. An application MUST also use a protocol supported by the server in order to connect and exchange messages.

Sender
A sender is a type of application, that is sending messages to channels. A sender MAY send to multiple channels depending on the server, protocol, and use-case pattern.

Receiver
A receiver is a type of application that is receiving messages from channels. A receiver MAY receive from multiple channels depending on the server, protocol, and the use-case pattern. A receiver MAY forward a received message further without changing it. A receiver MAY act as a consumer and react to the message. A receiver MAY act as a processor that, for example, aggregates multiple messages in one and forwards them.

Message
A message is the mechanism by which information is exchanged via a channel between servers and applications. A message MAY contain a payload and MAY also contain headers. The headers MAY be subdivided into protocol-defined headers and header properties defined by the application which can act as supporting metadata. The payload contains the data, defined by the application, which MUST be serialized into a format (JSON, XML, Avro, binary, etc.). Since a message is a generic mechanism, it can support multiple interaction patterns such as event, command, request, or response.

Channel
A channel is an addressable component, made available by the server, for the organization of messages. Sender applications send messages to channels and receiver applications receive messages from channels. Servers MAY support many channel instances, allowing messages with different content to be addressed to different channels. Depending on the server implementation, the channel MAY be included in the message via protocol-defined headers.

Protocol
A protocol is the mechanism (wireline protocol or API) by which messages are exchanged between the application and the channel. Example protocols include, but are not limited to, AMQP, HTTP, JMS, Kafka, Anypoint MQ, MQTT, Solace, STOMP, Mercure, WebSocket, Google Pub/Sub, Pulsar.

Bindings
A "binding" (or "protocol binding") is a mechanism to define protocol-specific information. Therefore, a protocol binding MUST define protocol-specific information only.

Specification
Format
The files describing the message-driven API in accordance with the AsyncAPI Specification are represented as JSON objects and conform to the JSON standards. YAML, being a superset of JSON, can be used as well to represent a A2S (AsyncAPI Specification) file.

For example, if a field is said to have an array value, the JSON array representation will be used:


{
   "field" : [...]
}
While the API is described using JSON it does not impose a JSON input/output to the API itself.

All field names in the specification are case sensitive.

The schema exposes two types of fields. Fixed fields, which have a declared name, and Patterned fields, which declare a regex pattern for the field name. Patterned fields can have multiple occurrences as long as each has a unique name.

In order to preserve the ability to round-trip between YAML and JSON formats, YAML version 1.2 is recommended along with some additional constraints:

Tags MUST be limited to those allowed by the JSON Schema ruleset
Keys used in YAML maps MUST be limited to a scalar string, as defined by the YAML Failsafe schema ruleset
File Structure
An AsyncAPI document MAY be made up of a single document or be divided into multiple, connected parts at the discretion of the author. In the latter case, Reference Objects are used.

It is important to note that everything that is defined in an AsyncAPI document MUST be used by the implemented Application, with the exception of the Components Object. Everything that is defined inside the Components Object represents a resource that MAY or MAY NOT be used by the implemented Application.

By convention, the AsyncAPI Specification (A2S) file is named asyncapi.json or asyncapi.yaml.

Absolute URLs
Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are absolute URLs are defined by RFC3986, section 4.3.

Schema
AsyncAPI Object
This is the root document object for the API specification. It combines resource listing and API declaration together into one document.

Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Description
asyncapi	AsyncAPI Version String	REQUIRED. Specifies the AsyncAPI Specification version being used. It can be used by tooling Specifications and clients to interpret the version. The structure shall be major.minor.patch, where patch versions must be compatible with the existing major.minor tooling. Typically patch versions will be introduced to address errors in the documentation, and tooling should typically be compatible with the corresponding major.minor (1.0.*). Patch versions will correspond to patches of this document.
id	Identifier	Identifier of the application the AsyncAPI document is defining.
info	Info Object	REQUIRED. Provides metadata about the API. The metadata can be used by the clients if needed.
servers	Servers Object	Provides connection details of servers.
defaultContentType	Default Content Type	Default content type to use when encoding/decoding a message's payload.
channels	Channels Object	The channels used by this application.
operations	Operations Object	The operations this application MUST implement.
components	Components Object	An element to hold various reusable objects for the specification. Everything that is defined inside this object represents a resource that MAY or MAY NOT be used in the rest of the document and MAY or MAY NOT be used by the implemented Application.
This object MAY be extended with Specification Extensions.

AsyncAPI Version String
The version string signifies the version of the AsyncAPI Specification that the document complies to. The format for this string must be major.minor.patch. The patch may be suffixed by a hyphen and extra alphanumeric characters.

A major.minor shall be used to designate the AsyncAPI Specification version, and will be considered compatible with the AsyncAPI Specification specified by that major.minor version. The patch version will not be considered by tooling, making no distinction between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1.

In subsequent versions of the AsyncAPI Specification, care will be given such that increments of the minor version should not interfere with operations of tooling developed to a lower minor version. Thus a hypothetical 1.1.0 specification should be usable with tooling designed for 1.0.0.

Identifier
This field represents a unique universal identifier of the application the AsyncAPI document is defining. It must conform to the URI format, according to RFC3986.

It is RECOMMENDED to use a URN to globally and uniquely identify the application during long periods of time, even after it becomes unavailable or ceases to exist.

Channel Object
Describes a shared communication channel.

Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Description
address	string | null	An optional string representation of this channel's address. The address is typically the "topic name", "routing key", "event type", or "path". When null or absent, it MUST be interpreted as unknown. This is useful when the address is generated dynamically at runtime or can't be known upfront. It MAY contain Channel Address Expressions. Query parameters and fragments SHALL NOT be used, instead use bindings to define them.
messages	Messages Object	A map of the messages that will be sent to this channel by any application at any time. Every message sent to this channel MUST be valid against one, and only one, of the message objects defined in this map.

If the channel is located in the Components Object, it MAY point to a Server Objects in any location. If servers is absent or empty, this channel MUST be available on all the servers defined in the Servers Object. Please note the servers property value MUST be an array of Reference Objects and, therefore, MUST NOT contain an array of Server Objects. However, it is RECOMMENDED that parsers (or other software) dereference this property for a better development experience.
parameters	Parameters Object	A map of the parameters included in the channel address. It MUST be present only when the address contains Channel Address Expressions.

Multi Format Schema Object
The Multi Format Schema Object represents a schema definition. It differs from the Schema Object in that it supports multiple schema formats or languages (e.g., JSON Schema, Avro, etc.).

Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Description
schemaFormat	string	Required. A string containing the name of the schema format that is used to define the information. If schemaFormat is missing, it MUST default to application/vnd.aai.asyncapi+json;version={{asyncapi}} where {{asyncapi}} matches the AsyncAPI Version String. In such a case, this would make the Multi Format Schema Object equivalent to the Schema Object. When using Reference Object within the schema, the schemaFormat of the resource being referenced MUST match the schemaFormat of the schema that contains the initial reference. For example, if you reference Avro schema, then schemaFormat of referencing resource and the resource being reference MUST match.

Check out the supported schema formats table for more information. Custom values are allowed but their implementation is OPTIONAL. A custom value MUST NOT refer to one of the schema formats listed in the table.

When using Reference Objects within the schema, the schemaFormat of the referenced resource MUST match the schemaFormat of the schema containing the reference.
schema	any	Required. Definition of the message payload. It can be of any type but defaults to Schema Object. It MUST match the schema format defined in schemaFormat, including the encoding type. E.g., Avro should be inlined as either a YAML or JSON object instead of as a string to be parsed as YAML or JSON. Non-JSON-based schemas (e.g., Protobuf or XSD) MUST be inlined as a string.
This object MAY be extended with Specification Extensions.

Schema formats table
The following table contains a set of values that every implementation MUST support.

Name	Allowed values	Notes
AsyncAPI 3.0.0 Schema Object	application/vnd.aai.asyncapi;version=3.0.0, application/vnd.aai.asyncapi+json;version=3.0.0, application/vnd.aai.asyncapi+yaml;version=3.0.0	This is the default when a schemaFormat is not provided.
JSON Schema Draft 07	application/schema+json;version=draft-07, application/schema+yaml;version=draft-07	
The following table contains a set of values that every implementation is RECOMMENDED to support.

Name	Allowed values	Notes
Avro 1.9.0 schema	application/vnd.apache.avro;version=1.9.0, application/vnd.apache.avro+json;version=1.9.0, application/vnd.apache.avro+yaml;version=1.9.0	
OpenAPI 3.0.0 Schema Object	application/vnd.oai.openapi;version=3.0.0, application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0.0, application/vnd.oai.openapi+yaml;version=3.0.0	
RAML 1.0 data type	application/raml+yaml;version=1.0

Schema Object
The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is a superset of the JSON Schema Specification Draft 07. The empty schema (which allows any instance to validate) MAY be represented by the boolean value true and a schema which allows no instance to validate MAY be represented by the boolean value false.

Further information about the properties can be found in JSON Schema Core and JSON Schema Validation. Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema specification as referenced here. For other formats (e.g., Avro, RAML, etc) see Multi Format Schema Object.

Properties
The AsyncAPI Schema Object is a JSON Schema vocabulary which extends JSON Schema Core and Validation vocabularies. As such, any keyword available for those vocabularies is by definition available in AsyncAPI, and will work the exact same way, including but not limited to:

title

required
multipleOf
maximum

minimum

maxLength

The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were adjusted to the AsyncAPI Specification.

description - CommonMark syntax can be used for rich text representation.
format - See Data Type Formats for further details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined formats, the AsyncAPI Specification offers a few additional predefined formats.
default - Use it to specify that property has a predefined value if no other value is present. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the Schema Object defined at the same level. For example, of type is string, then default can be "foo" but cannot be 1.
Alternatively, any time a Schema Object can be used, a Reference Object can be used in its place. This allows referencing definitions in place of defining them inline. It is appropriate to clarify that the $ref keyword MUST follow the behavior described by Reference Object instead of the one in JSON Schema definition.

In addition to the JSON Schema fields, the following AsyncAPI vocabulary fields MAY be used for further schema documentation:

Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Description
discriminator	string	Adds support for polymorphism. The discriminator is the schema property name that is used to differentiate between other schema that inherit this schema. The property name used MUST be defined at this schema and it MUST be in the required property list. When used, the value MUST be the name of this schema or any schema that inherits it. See Composition and Inheritance for more details.
externalDocs	External Documentation Object | Reference Object	Additional external documentation for this schema.
deprecated	boolean	Specifies that a schema is deprecated and SHOULD be transitioned out of usage. Default value is false.
This object MAY be extended with Specification Extensions.

Composition and Inheritance (Polymorphism)
The AsyncAPI Specification allows combining and extending model definitions using the allOf property of JSON Schema, in effect offering model composition. allOf takes in an array of object definitions that are validated independently but together compose a single object.

While composition offers model extensibility, it does not imply a hierarchy between the models. To support polymorphism, AsyncAPI Specification adds the support of the discriminator field. When used, the discriminator will be the name of the property used to decide which schema definition is used to validate the structure of the model. As such, the discriminator field MUST be a required field. There are two ways to define the value of a discriminator for an inheriting instance.

Use the schema's name.
Override the schema's name by overriding the property with a new value. If exists, this takes precedence over the schema's name.
As such, inline schema definitions, which do not have a given id, cannot be used in polymorphism.

Security Scheme Object
Defines a security scheme that can be used by the operations. Supported schemes are:

User/Password.
API key (either as user or as password).
X.509 certificate.
End-to-end encryption (either symmetric or asymmetric).
HTTP authentication.
HTTP API key.
OAuth2's common flows (Implicit, Resource Owner Protected Credentials, Client Credentials and Authorization Code) as defined in RFC6749.
OpenID Connect Discovery.
SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) as defined in RFC4422.
Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Applies To	Description
type	string	Any	REQUIRED. The type of the security scheme. Valid values are "userPassword", "apiKey", "X509", "symmetricEncryption", "asymmetricEncryption", "httpApiKey", "http", "oauth2", "openIdConnect", "plain", "scramSha256", "scramSha512", and "gssapi".
description	string	Any	A short description for security scheme. CommonMark syntax MAY be used for rich text representation.
name	string	httpApiKey	REQUIRED. The name of the header, query or cookie parameter to be used.
in	string	apiKey | httpApiKey	REQUIRED. The location of the API key. Valid values are "user" and "password" for apiKey and "query", "header" or "cookie" for httpApiKey.
scheme	string	http	REQUIRED. The name of the HTTP Authorization scheme to be used in the Authorization header as defined in RFC7235.

Correlation ID Object
An object that specifies an identifier at design time that can used for message tracing and correlation.

For specifying and computing the location of a Correlation ID, a runtime expression is used.

Fixed Fields
Field Name	Type	Description
description	string	An optional description of the identifier. CommonMark syntax can be used for rich text representation.
location	string	REQUIRED. A runtime expression that specifies the location of the correlation ID.
This object MAY be extended with Specification Extensions.

Examples

{
  "description": "Default Correlation ID",
  "location": "$message.header#/correlationId"
}

description: Default Correlation ID
location: $message.header#/correlationId
Runtime Expression
A runtime expression allows values to be defined based on information that will be available within the message. This mechanism is used by Correlation ID Object and Operation Reply Address Object.

The runtime expression is defined by the following ABNF syntax:


      expression = ( "$message" "." source )
      source = ( header-reference | payload-reference )
      header-reference = "header" ["#" fragment]
      payload-reference = "payload" ["#" fragment]
      fragment = a JSON Pointer [RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)
The table below provides examples of runtime expressions and examples of their use in a value:

Examples
Source Location	Example expression	Notes
Message Header Property	$message.header#/MQMD/CorrelId	Correlation ID is set using the CorrelId value from the MQMD header.
Message Payload Property	$message.payload#/messageId	Correlation ID is set using the messageId value from the message payload.
Runtime expressions preserve the type of the referenced value.

Traits Merge Mechanism
Traits MUST be merged with the target object using the JSON Merge Patch algorithm in the same order they are defined. A property on a trait MUST NOT override the same property on the target object.

Example
An object like the following:


description: A longer description.
traits:
  - name: UserSignup
    description: Description from trait.
  - tags:
      - name: user
Would look like the following after applying traits:


name: UserSignup
description: A longer description.
tags:
  - name: user
Specification Extensions
While the AsyncAPI Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

The extensions properties are implemented as patterned fields that are always prefixed by "x-".

Field Pattern	Type	Description
^x-[\w\d\.\x2d_]+$	Any	Allows extensions to the AsyncAPI Schema. The field name MUST begin with x-, for example, x-internal-id. The value can be null, a primitive, an array or an object. Can have any valid JSON format value.
The extensions may or may not be supported by the available tooling, but those may be extended as well to add requested support (if tools are internal or open-sourced).

Data Type Formats
Primitives have an optional modifier property: format. The AsyncAPI specification uses several known formats to more finely define the data type being used. However, the format property is an open string-valued property, and can have any value to support documentation needs. Formats such as "email", "uuid", etc., can be used even though they are not defined by this specification. Types that are not accompanied by a format property follow their definition from the JSON Schema. Tools that do not recognize a specific format MAY default back to the type alone, as if the format was not specified.

The formats defined by the AsyncAPI Specification are:

Common Name	type	format	Comments
integer	integer	int32	signed 32 bits
long	integer	int64	signed 64 bits
float	number	float	
double	number	double	
string	string		
byte	string	byte	base64 encoded characters
binary	string	binary	any sequence of octets
boolean	boolean		
date	string	date	As defined by full-date - RFC3339
dateTime	string	date-time	As defined by date-time - RFC3339
password	string	password	Used to hint UIs the input needs to be obscured.
